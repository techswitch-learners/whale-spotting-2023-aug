Bryde's whale,Balaenoptera brydei,"Bryde''s whale, or the Bryde''s whale complex, putatively comprises three species of rorqual and maybe four. The 'complex'"" means the number and classification remains unclear because of a lack of definitive information and research."""
False killer whale,Pseudorca crassidens,The false killer whale is a species of oceanic dolphin that is the only extant representative of the genus Pseudorca. It is found in oceans worldwide but mainly in tropical regions.
Fin whale,Balaenoptera physalus,"The fin whale, also known as finback whale or common rorqual and formerly known as herring whale or razorback whale, is a cetacean belonging to the parvorder of baleen whales. It is the second-longest species of cetacean on Earth after the blue whale."
